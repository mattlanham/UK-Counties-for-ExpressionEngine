This is a simple SQL file that will import all UK counties into your ExpressionEngine categories table, there are 2 SQL variables that you should edit before running this file, they are located on the first 2 lines of the SQL file.

SET @site_id='1'; 
This should be set to the correct site_id for your ExpressionEngine site, you can check this out quickly by opening the existing exp_categories table.

SET @group_id='1'; 
This is the Category group you want these new categories to be imported to, create this in ExpressionEngine first then take a note of the ID from the control panel, or again you can look in exp_categories.

If you've got any questions or comments then feel free to email to me@matthewlanham.co.uk, check out my website for future ExpressionEngine related goodies http://matthewlanham.co.uk.

The counties used in this SQL file are based on those from the following website:
